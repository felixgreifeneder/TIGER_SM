{"ALG_DESC": "This script is intended to be used within the processing plugin of QGIS. It allows the create an estimated soil moisture map utilising Copernicus Sentinel-1 backscatter measurements. The retrieval of soil moisture is based on a Support-Vector-Regression machine learning approach. The model training was performed, based on in-situ data collected within several field campaigns in Kenya. The development of this software and the collection of in-situ data was supported by funding of the European Space Agency project framework \"TIGER Bridge\" within the project \"Synergy of multi-temporal Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 image for soil water resources monitoring in Africa\". For details about the applied approach, please see:\nPasolli, L., C. Notarnicola, G. Bertoldi, L. Bruzzone, R. Remelgado, F. Greifeneder, G. Niedrist, S. Della Chiesa, U. Tappeiner, and M.
